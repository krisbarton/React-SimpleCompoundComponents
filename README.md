# React-SimpleCompoundComponents

I love the concept of the compound component architecture in React (a big shout out to Karl Hadwen for first bringing it to my attention. His Youtube channel is excellent BTW, check it out @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1DUQiZduv_yNZy0O7n_iHA).

## What is the Compound Component Architecture

I like user compound components to create highly functional and re-useable components without the need for prop dirlling.

You can find a great explanation of Compound Components and why they're useful here: https://medium.com/better-programming/mastering-the-compound-component-pattern-cd0e56937fc3#:~:text=What's%20a%20compound%20component%3F,the%20HTML%20select%20and%20option%20.

## What am I using Compound Components for in this example?

I have a cocktail website (https://www.thatcocktail.com) and I'm planning out a new landing page.

I want to my latest articles/recipes and I want the layout to alternate between img and then desctiption to the description and then img. 

Compound components can easily accomplish this, making the component template easily readable.
